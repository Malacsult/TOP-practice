        <h1>This is 'Heading 1', which is the most important</h1>
        <h6>And this is 'Heading 6', which is the least important of the headings</h6>
        <p>There are <strong>no</strong> h7 or anything beyond h6</p>
        <p>I just used a <em>strong</em> element, which makes the text bold and also gives it importance, opposed to using b </p>
        <p>Same goes for using em (emphasis) instead of i, it gives more meaning to the page, rather than just visuals.</p>
        <!--I was gonna use <b> and <i> in the paragrahps, but they would turn into commands
            ... I have no idea how to get around this, but I'm sure there's a way.

    </body>
<!--I *almost* nailed this page first try. Almost because my code originally was:
<p>There are <strong>no</strong>h7 or anything ...
    Which printed out to : There are noh7 or anything...
    I forgot a space! .. I also made this mistake when I demonstrated the em element
    I am still satisfied though :)
